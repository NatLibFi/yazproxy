New attribute "backendtype" for syntax section which specifies
record syntax to be transmitted to backend. This allows proxy to
offer a record syntax different from that offered by backend.

YAZ proxy no longer transmits element set name to backend target when
doing schema conversions. It just gets unset instead (it's optional).

Use YAZ_DOC macro to setup documentation. Added yaz.m4.

YAZ proxy control script renamed from yaz-proxy.sh to yazproxyctl.sh.

YAZ proxy executable renamed from yaz-proxy to yaz-proxy.

Older versions of YAZ proxy was part of YAZ++. We've split the
YAZ proxy into a separate project.
