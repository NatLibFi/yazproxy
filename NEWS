YAZ Proxy may use USEMARCON to convert between various MARC
formats. Use --with-usemarcon to specify Usemarcon location.
See config-mafi2ma.xml for an example configuration.
Requires USEMARCON 1.5, which can be fetched from:
 http://www.bl.uk/services/bibliographic/usemarcon.html

Added support for XInclude for configuration file(s) so that
configuration can be partitioned in multiple files.

Fixed bug #189: Bad authenticated session transfer.

New config element "authentication" which specifies authentication
(Open v2/v3 Z39.50) to be used for backend.

New config attribute "backendcharset" for syntax element which specifies
charset (encoding) for record that is returned by backend. If omitted
the proxy assumes backend record encoding is MARC-8 (for backwards
compatibility). 

New config attribute "backendtype" for syntax element which specifies
record syntax to be transmitted to backend. This allows proxy to
offer a record syntax different from that offered by backend.

YAZ proxy no longer transmits element set name to backend target when
doing schema conversions. It just gets unset instead (it's optional).

Use YAZ_DOC macro to setup documentation. Added yaz.m4.

YAZ proxy control script renamed from yaz-proxy.sh to yazproxyctl.sh.

YAZ proxy executable renamed from yaz-proxy to yaz-proxy.

Older versions of YAZ proxy was part of YAZ++. We've split the
YAZ proxy into a separate project.
